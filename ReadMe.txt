Since this script doesn't have modes, I initially set it up to have the bottom four rows of pads act as drum pads, while the top four rows controlled clips, however, if you only want clip control just set DRUM_PADS_ENABLED in MIDI_MAP.py to 0.

All of the mappings in MIDI_Map.py work but there are constraints on mappable paremeters, for example, duplicate, quantize, etc. won't work like they do in the standard Push 2 script but they can be remapped to control something else.

I encourage you to set up your own mapping in MIDI_Map.py to suit your own preferences.

Feel free to contribute, make a pull request, and ask questions if you're having any issues. To ask a question, just file it as an issue under this GitHub repo and I'll mark it as such when I see it.
